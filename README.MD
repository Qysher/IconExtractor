# Usage
1. Download the latest version under the [Release](https://github.com/Qysher/IconExtractor/releases/tag/release) tab. 
2. Extract the files into a seperate folder (**all three files have to be in the same directory**).
3. Simply drag and drop any .exe on **extract_icon.bat**. A console window should now open and close again shortly afterwards.
4. Open the **output** folder, inside should be a folder named after the .exe file from the last step. Inside should be the .exe's icons.
